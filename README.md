## Problem

Rate of Corona spread is increasing day by day throughout world.
We still do not have a proper cure for this. But we can reduce it if
we stop its spreadness, and so this App will help us to achieve it.


## Solution

-Safety tips to make people stay safe

-Help line so that any person can get benefit from it during emergency

-Instant info i.e, confirmed cases, active cases etc (gov. based) about any place

-By the help of this app, an circular area will be made about his home like around
200 m. so that if he/she leaves it, he/she will get notification accordingly
(example - Geofence)

-Instant info about the different zones i.e, red, yellow and green(gov. based). So
that if any person gets into different zone he/she will get notification.
